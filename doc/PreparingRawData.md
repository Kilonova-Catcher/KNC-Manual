## Preparing Your Raw Data

Before you dive into preprocessing and stacking your images, itâ€™s important to make sure your files are cleanly organized and contain the right metadata. This saves time, avoids mistakes, and helps ensure your data can be properly calibrated and analyzed â€” by you or by others.

### File Naming Conventions

Give your files clear, consistent names that describe what they are. This makes it much easier to group them into categories and ensures automated tools can correctly process them.

A good file name typically includes:
- **Target name** (e.g., M31, KN240101)
- **Filter used** (e.g., g, r, i)
- **Exposure time** (e.g., 60s)
- **Frame type** (light, dark, flat, bias) or **Stack** 
- **Date** or **session ID**
- **Your Name**

**Example file name:** GRB250317B_Freeberg_T180_2025-03-18T04-36-51_Sloan_r_Stack_40x180sec.fits

Many stacking tools (like ASTAP or Prism) can sort files automatically if your naming system is consistent.

### Stacking 
When youâ€™re capturing something faint â€” like a kilonova at the edge of detectability â€” a single image often isnâ€™t enough. It might be noisy, unclear, or even completely blank at first glance.

Thatâ€™s where **stacking** comes in.

Stacking is the process of **combining multiple exposures** of the same target to create a single image with **less noise and more signal**.

---

### ðŸ”Š Signal vs. Noise

Letâ€™s break it down:

- The **signal** in your image â€” the light from stars, galaxies, or a kilonova â€” is real. It stays in the same place in every frame.
- The **noise** â€” from your camera, electronics, or atmosphere â€” is random. Itâ€™s different in every frame.

When you stack images:
- The signal **adds up** (gets stronger)
- The noise **averages out** (gets weaker)

This improves the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**, making faint objects stand out from the background.

### Benefits of Stacking

- Makes faint transients (like kilonovae) visible  
- Reveals dim details in galaxies, supernova remnants, or jets  
- Reduces graininess (random noise)  
- Increases photometric accuracy (brightness measurements)  
- Helps confirm if a candidate source is real or just noise

With just one frame, a kilonova might look like random static. But after stacking 5, 10, or 20 frames, it may become unmistakable â€” a real source that wasn't obvious before.

### How Many Frames Should I Stack?

Thereâ€™s no magic number, but here are general guidelines:

| Goal                         | Number of Frames  |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Bright target photometry     | 3â€“5               |
| Faint transient detection     | 10â€“30             |
| Deep-sky imaging             | 30â€“100+           |

The more you stack, the better your result â€” as long as your tracking is solid and the frames are well-aligned.

### Tools for Stacking

Most amateur-friendly tools support stacking automatically:
- **ASTAP**: Fast, automatic star alignment and stacking
- **Prism**: Scripted stacking during preprocessing
- **Siril**: Powerful stacking and preprocessing workflow
- **DeepSkyStacker**: Easy visual interface for stacking

Each has options for **median**, **average**, or **sigma-clipping** stacking, depending on your goals and number of frames.

**More frames = more signal = better science.**

Stacking is a key part of transforming raw, noisy exposures into meaningful data!

### FITS Files and The Importance of Metadata

When working in astronomy, you'll hear a lot about **FITS files** â€” and almost all your images from the telescope will be saved in this format.

**FITS** stands for **Flexible Image Transport System**, and itâ€™s the standard file format used in astronomy around the world.

FITS files are designed for **data**, not aesthetics.

Unlike JPGs or PNGs, which are meant to look nice on a screen, FITS files are meant to **store scientific information**. Every pixel value in a FITS file corresponds to actual light (photon counts) collected by your camera's sensor.

This data is essential for preprocessing, especially when you're:
- Measuring brightness (photometry)
- Solving for astrometry (needs RA/DEC, pixel scale, orientation)
- Detecting faint transients like kilonovae
- Sharing data across different software and observatories
- Matching lights with darks (based on exposure time, temperature, gain)
- Calibrating flats (based on filter)

A FITS file contains two main parts:

1. **Image Data**  
   - The actual image as a 2D array of numbers (not colors!)
   - Each number corresponds to the light intensity at each pixel

2. **Header**  
   - A block of metadata stored as text
   - Describes how the image was taken and how it should be interpreted

Key metadata often includes:
- `EXPTIME` â€“ Exposure time
- `FILTER` â€“ Filter name
- `DATE-OBS` â€“ Date/time of observation
- `CCD-TEMP` â€“ Sensor temperature
- `OBJECT` â€“ Target name
- `GAIN` or `ISO` â€“ Camera gain or ISO setting
- `BINNING` â€“ Binning mode (e.g., 1x1 or 2x2)

**Tip**: Most software tools will read this metadata automatically. If it's missing or incorrect, plate solving, stacking, or calibration may fail â€” so itâ€™s a good habit to double-check your FITS headers using a viewer like:
- **Siril**
- **FITS Liberator**
- **AstroImageJ**
- **ASTAP**
- **Prism**
