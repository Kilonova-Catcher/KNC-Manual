## What is Kilonova-Catcher and GRANDMA? 

**Kilonova-Catcher (KNC)** is the citizen science arm of **GRANDMA** - the Global Rapid Advanced Network Devoted to Multi-Messenger Astronomy. While GRANDMA coordinates a professional network of robotic and manually operated telescopes around the world, KNC empowers amateur astronomers to contribute directly to real-time gravitational wave and transient follow-up campaigns.

**KNC is led by a dedicated team:**

**KNC Principal Investigator (PI):** Dr. Damien Turpin

**GRANDMA Principal Investigator (PI):** Dr. Sarah Antier

**GRANDMA/KNC Operations Lead:** Cristina Andrade (Hi!)

### How It Works

1. **Alert Reception**  
   Potential kilonovae, GRBs, or supernovae are detected and broadcast via NASA’s GCN (Global Coordinates Network). These alerts are automatically ingested into **SkyPortal**, a professional data hub used by GRANDMA.

2. **Coordination with GRANDMA**  
   GRANDMA scientists and telescope coordinators use SkyPortal to assign targets and prioritize observations across their global telescope network.

3. **Citizen Scientist Activation**  
   Once a promising event is identified, KNC leaders extract the relevant target information from SkyPortal and distribute coordinates and observing instructions to KNC participants. This is done both automatically via the `#grbalerts` channel and manually by the scientists.

4. **Amateur Observations**  
   KNC members around the world perform follow-up observations using personal or institutional telescopes, then upload their images to the [KNC website](http://kilonovacatcher.in2p3.fr/).

5. **Data Analysis and Feedback**  
   Professional scientists analyze the submitted images and provide feedback to participants. Confirmed observations are used to measure the brightness and evolution of each transient.

6. **Photometry Submission**  
   Final photometric measurements are uploaded to SkyPortal, where they are combined with GRANDMA data to build light curves and support scientific publications.

### Real Impact

KNC and GRANDMA have already collaborated on several successful campaigns, including follow-up of gravitational wave events and the **SN2023wrk** supernova. These efforts show how professional–citizen partnerships can meaningfully advance discovery in multi-messenger astronomy.
